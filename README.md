# Purpose

Tuna is an experimental programming language with the goal of making scalable and durable applications as easy to develop as possible.


A more demonstrative MVP can be found at [this commit](https://github.com/Conder-Systems/tuna-lang/tree/44ef274f3f87e08391757bd714ca34c2bd1f5d72). Since then, Tuna has been undergoing a refactor/rearchitecture to 1) Move all compiler logic to rust. 2) Provide guarantees of no race conditions on global state automatically. 3) Enhance the interpreter to provide programming language niceties like pass-by-reference. 

There is no timeline for this work.
